TableBundle
===========

Upgrade for Symfony ~5.4.

I will try to update the documentation.

This bundle is based on [Jgm/TableBundle](https://github.com/jangemue/TableBundle) and is a bundle for the Symfony Framework (Symfony2 or higher), which is used to build data tables in PHP and render them easily with twig.
